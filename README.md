## Black Friday Sales Prediction

A retail company wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month. The model performance was evaluated on the basis of the prediction of the purchase amount for the test data (test.csv), which contains similar data-points as train except for their purchase amount. Submissions are scored on the root mean squared error (RMSE). 

Among the 21'300 participants registered for this specific competition at Analytics Vidhya, this notebook obtained a ranking in the top 3% in the leaderboard.

## 100K UK Used Car - Price Prediction Model

The purpose of this project is to practice insights and visualisations of a dataset and create a generalized UK used car price prediction model. Highest Achieved precision: 95.5%

## Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

In this project, we calculate a model by which a smartphone can detect its owner’s activity precisely. Activities that are predicted by using the smartphone’s sensors are (1-Walking, 2-Walking upstairs, 3-Walking downstairs, 4-Sitting, 5-Standing or 6-Laying). Highest Achieved precision: 98.8%

## Urban Sound Classification

The goal of this project is to practice audio processing in a classification scenario with Data Handling in Audio domain. This dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes. Audio files are converted to spectrogram images and then are classified with fastai's vision learner.

As of September 8, 2020, among the 7630 participants registered for this specific competition at Analytics Vidhya, this notebook obtained the 16th ranking in the leaderboard.
